# KEYLOGGER





A keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a type of software or hardware device that is designed to record and log every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers can be used for various purposes, both legitimate and malicious.

Legitimate Uses:

Security Testing: Security professionals may use keyloggers to test the vulnerability of a system and identify potential security risks.
Parental Control: Some parents use keyloggers to monitor their children's online activities and ensure their safety.
Employee Monitoring: Employers may use keyloggers to monitor employees' computer usage for security or productivity reasons, though this must be done in compliance with legal and ethical standards.
Malicious Uses:

Cybercrime: Malicious keyloggers are often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data.
Identity Theft: Keyloggers can be deployed to capture login credentials and other personal information to facilitate identity theft.
Espionage: State-sponsored actors or individuals may use keyloggers for espionage or to gather sensitive information.
Keyloggers can operate at different levels of a computer system. Hardware keyloggers are physical devices connected between the computer's keyboard and the computer itself, while software keyloggers are programs that run on the computer and record keystrokes. Malicious keyloggers can be distributed through malware, phishing attacks, or other deceptive means.

It's important to note that the use of keyloggers for malicious purposes is illegal and a violation of privacy. Protecting against keyloggers involves using security measures such as antivirus software, keeping software and operating systems up to date, and being cautious of suspicious emails or websites.
